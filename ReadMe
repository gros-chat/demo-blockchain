# deploy it with brownie on Ganache
# deploy it with a testnet ( Rinkeby)

# - once the goods is shipped, the sender is powerless
# - that is the good cannot be delivered to the buyer unless the buyer pays
# - the buyer does not pay, the shipping company keeps the goods
# - the shipping company is paid when the good is deliverd to the buyer or
# - upon returning the goods to sender if the buyer does not pay
